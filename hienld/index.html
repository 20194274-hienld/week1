                            When's the last time you've and an Italian soda? It had been a while for me, but I wanted to join my friend fir a non-caffeinated beverage at Bytes and I bacame reaquainted with the combination of
                            fizzy water and artificial fruit syrup. Italian sodas are not so sweet as a normal soda and not so boring as a flavored carbonated water.
                            The Italian sodas at bytes alse have cream in them (or maybe they do if you ask; i haven't tried), which makes it a nice coffee shop alternative for the times when you're feeling a refreshing drink
                            that doesn't have caffeine or milk.
